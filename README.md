# Machine-Learning-Data-cleaning
This repository contains a practical Jupyter Notebook focused on data cleaning â€” a critical step in any machine learning workflow. The project demonstrates how to preprocess raw data using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. It includes:

Identifying and handling missing values

Removing or imputing duplicates

Detecting and treating outliers

Formatting and converting data types

Normalization and scaling

Encoding categorical variables

Saving the cleaned dataset for modeling

This notebook is beginner-friendly and useful for students, data analysts, and ML practitioners who want to learn how to prepare high-quality input data for machine learning models.
